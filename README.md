# wts-issue-test

This is a temporary repository to explore ways of improving the quality of issues created on the [Windows Template Studio](https://aka.ms/wts) repository. We want to make it easier for people reporting issues to provide the information that will help use respond quickly and appropriately, rather than asking for more information.

1. Refamiliarize yourself with [the current options when creating an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/issues/new/choose).
2. [Create a new issue here](https://github.com/mrlacey/wts-issue-test/issues/new/choose) (bug or feature request) and notice the differences.
3. View the created issues and notice the differences.
4. Give feedback on what you think of the new versions.
