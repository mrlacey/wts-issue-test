# wts-issue-test

This is a temporary repository to explore ways of improving the quality of issues created on the [Windows Template Studio](https://aka.ms/wts) repository.

1. Refamiliarize yourself with [the current options when creating an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/issues/new/choose).
2. [Create a new issue here](https://github.com/mrlacey/wts-issue-test/issues/new/choose) (any sort) and notice the difference.
3. Give feedback on what you think of the new versions.
